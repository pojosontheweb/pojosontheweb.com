    Woko: POJOs on the Web!
</h1>

Woko is a Full-Stack, [Domain Driven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) framework for the Java platform.

It is designed around a few basic principles that allow to code better webapps, faster :

* _Domain_ and _Role Driven_ : Woko works with Objects, and aims at allowing your users to work with them too.
* Use _metadata_ : Woko tries to grab the most it can from your code, so that it can provide many features out of the box.
* Sensible _defaults_ : Works out of the box, without config or extension, but allows to customize everything when you need it.
* _KISS_ : Woko is simple, that's why it works.

            Object Renderer
        </h2>
        <p>
            Woko uses a unique, dynamic and powerful approach for automagically rendering
            your POJOs. It can render any object by default (read or write), and lets
            you customize anything at will.

            RPC-enabled
        </h2>
        <p>
            Automatic, zero-code JSON/HTTP services for your POJOs. Woko has
            endpoints for accessing your POJOs in a RPC fashion. It even has a
            JavaScript API that eases AJAX stuff.
