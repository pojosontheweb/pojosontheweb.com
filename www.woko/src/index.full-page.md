            Woko is a Full-Stack,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">Domain-Driven</a> framework for
            the Java platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is designed around a few basic principles that allow to
            code better webapps, faster :
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Domain and Role Driven : Woko works with Objects, and aims at allowing your users to work with them too.</li>
            <li>Use metadata : Woko tries to grab the most it can from your code, so that it can provide many features out of the box.</li>
            <li>Sensible defaults : Works out of the box, without config or extension, but allows to customize everything when you need it.</li>
            <li>KISS : Woko is simple, that's why it works.</li>
        </ul>
